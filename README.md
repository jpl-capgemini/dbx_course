# dbx_course

Welcome to this Databricks (dbx) course. In these series of notebooks, we will start to learn the basics of dbx. We will start with some basic PySpark operations in databricks. We will gradually increase the difficulty of the exercises and apply your learned skills in a case. We will work through a dataset of a hypothetical store and try to answer some business questions and create a interactive dashboard to present our findings. 

Good luck and have fun with the exercises.
